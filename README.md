# Simple Todo List

This is a simple todo list project in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for persistence the data with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-prisma) as ORM.

This project helps me for understanding how to develop <u>seperate the rendering between server and client side</u> since Next.JS v13+ has supported it.

## Getting Started

First, do the installiton

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
